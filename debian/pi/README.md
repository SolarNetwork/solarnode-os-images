# SolarNode Raspberry Pi Images

These images were created for the the [Raspberry Pi][1], based 
off the [Node OS Setup Guide - Raspbian][2].

The image names are in the form `[OS]-[hardware]-[SD size]`. **Note**
that you can copy the image to a _larger_ SD card, but you must then
expand the root filesystem, or add another partition, to make use of
the additional space.

The *hardware* names are as follows:

 * `pi` - the 512MB RAM version of the [Raspberry Pi][1] (Pi 2/3 supported
   as well)
 	
# How to copy images to SD card

To restore these onto a SD card, run the following command:

	# Copy image to SD card located at /dev/sde
	xz -cd solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img.xz |dd of=/dev/sde bs=2M
	
	# Sync to disk
	sync
	
	# Re-read the partition table
	blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sde
	
	# Just to be sure, let's check the root filesystem
	e2fsck -f /dev/sde2

# Network setup

The OS will attempt to get a network connection using the built-in
ethernet device, and use DHCP to obtain an IP address, using the hostname
**solarnode**. Once the computer has fully booted after turning it on (this
can take several minutes) check your DHCP server to find what IP address was
allocated.

# Login user

The system contains a default user of `solar` with password `solar`. That user can
use `sudo` to become the `root` user. You can access the computer via `ssh` only.

# Base SolarNode framework

A base SolarNode framework has been installed in this image. Once the computer has
fully booted and the SolarNode framework has started (this can take several minutes
after the OS has booted and `ssh` is available) you can visit

	http://solarnode/

where `solarnode` is the IP address of the device, if your DNS server does not
support using the _solarnode_ hostname.

# Image partition info

The 1GB images are paritioned like this:

```
Device     Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sde1        8192   96453   88262 43.1M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/sde2       98304 1949695 1851392  904M 83 Linux
```

The image is copied with a `dd` command like this:

```
dd if=/dev/sde conv=sync,noerror bs=4k count=243712 of=solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img
```

The image is then compressed, and then a digest computed like this:

```
xz -c -9 solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img >solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img.xz
sha256sum solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img.xz >solarnode-deb8-pi-1GB.img.xz.sha256
```
